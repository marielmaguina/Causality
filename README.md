# Granger_Causality_Transfer_Entropy
Comparing Granger Causality and Transfer Entropy

A comparative analysis of Granger Causality and Transfer Entropy to evaluate their effectiveness in detecting causality in time series data.
In this repository, you will find the R code used to conduct the simulations as well as the final report containing my findings.
